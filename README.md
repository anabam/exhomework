###Instructions
1. The project should provide a RESTful web service.

  a. The web service accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. I.e. given n  = 5, appropriate output would represent the sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].

  b. Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error.

2. Include whatever instructions are necessary to build and deploy/run the project, where "deploy/run" means the web service is accepting requests and responding to them as appropriate.

3. Include some unit and/or functional tests

4. Use any language that you know well
